# Gulp Quick Start for Web Designers

An example to demonstrate how `gulpfile.js` is more expressive than `Gruntfile.js`. Inspired by [Grunt Quick Start for Web Designers](http://hyper-text.org/archives/2014/01/grunt_quick_start_for_web_designer.shtml).

## Play around

```
npm install
gulp
```

And check out `htdocs/dist`.

Also, you can watch file changes with `gulp watch`.
